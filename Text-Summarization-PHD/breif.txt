here's a brief summary:

The code snippets are related to natural language processing and specifically text summarization. They include:

1. The `BM25_` function that ranks documents based on relevance to a query by computing the inverse document frequency, document length, average word length, and TextRank score for each query term.

2. A sequence-to-sequence model with LSTM cells that takes in article sequences and outputs predicted summary words.

3. Model training using the Keras API and evaluation on test data.

4. The `generate_summary` function that preprocesses input data, applies the `BM25_` function to select top-k documents, generates an initial summary using the trained model, and applies the TextRank algorithm to generate the final summary.

Overall, these code snippets demonstrate one approach to generating summaries from text using deep learning techniques.
